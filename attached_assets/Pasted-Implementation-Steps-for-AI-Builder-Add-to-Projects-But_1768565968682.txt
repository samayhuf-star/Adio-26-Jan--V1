Implementation Steps for AI Builder: Add to Projects Button in Campaign Listing
Step 1: Verify Database Structure
	∙	Check if tags table exists with fields for storing projects (name, color, user_id)
	∙	Check if tag_items junction table exists to link campaigns with projects
	∙	Verify there’s a way to identify which tags are “projects” (type field or separate table)
Step 2: Verify/Create Backend APIs
	∙	Ensure API endpoint exists to GET all projects for logged-in user
	∙	Ensure API endpoint exists to POST (create) new project
	∙	Ensure API endpoint exists to POST (assign) projects to a campaign
	∙	Ensure API endpoint exists to GET projects already assigned to a specific campaign
Step 3: Create Project Assignment Dropdown Component
	∙	Build a reusable dropdown component that opens when button is clicked
	∙	Component should have input field at top to create new project on-the-fly
	∙	Component should display list of all existing projects with checkboxes
	∙	Component should show which projects are already assigned (pre-checked)
	∙	Component should allow selecting/deselecting multiple projects
	∙	Component should have Save and Cancel buttons at bottom
Step 4: Add “Add to Projects” Button in Campaign Listing
	∙	Add new button in each campaign row (in Actions column or separate Projects column)
	∙	Button should show count of assigned projects, like “Projects (2)”
	∙	Clicking button should open the Project Assignment Dropdown component
	∙	Pass campaign ID to the dropdown component
Step 5: Display Assigned Projects in Campaign Listing
	∙	Add a new column called “Projects” in the campaign table
	∙	Display assigned projects as colored pills/badges in this column
	∙	Show project name and use project color for the pill background
Step 6: Update Campaign Listing Data Fetch
	∙	Modify the API call that fetches campaigns to also include assigned projects
	∙	Each campaign object should include array of project objects (id, name, color)
Step 7: Handle Create New Project On-the-Fly
	∙	When user types project name and presses Enter or clicks Create button
	∙	Call API to create new project
	∙	Add newly created project to the dropdown list immediately
	∙	Automatically check/select the newly created project
	∙	Clear the input field after creation
Step 8: Handle Save Projects
	∙	When user clicks Save button in dropdown
	∙	Send all selected project IDs to the backend API
	∙	Update the campaign row to show newly assigned projects
	∙	Close the dropdown
	∙	Refresh the project pills display
Step 9: Test the Complete Flow
	∙	Open dropdown on any campaign
	∙	Create a new project from the dropdown
	∙	Assign multiple existing projects to campaign
	∙	Click Save and verify projects appear as pills
	∙	Refresh page and verify projects are still assigned
	∙	Test with multiple campaigns
Step 10: Add Loading States and Error Handling
	∙	Show loading indicator when fetching projects
	∙	Show loading indicator when saving assignments
	∙	Display error message if API calls fail
	∙	Disable Save button while request is in progress

That’s it. These 10 steps cover the complete implementation.
