Step 1: Check if Button Has Click Handler

Verify the "+ Add project" button has an onClick event attached
Check browser console for any JavaScript errors when clicking the button
Ensure the click event is not being blocked by parent elements

Step 2: Verify Dropdown Component is Imported

Check if the ProjectAssignmentDropdown (or TagDropdown) component is imported in the Saved Keyword Lists page
Verify the component file exists and has no syntax errors

Step 3: Check State Management

Verify there's a state variable to control dropdown open/close (like isDropdownOpen)
Ensure clicking the button toggles this state
Check if the dropdown component is conditionally rendered based on this state

Step 4: Test Button Functionality

Add a simple console.log("Button clicked") inside the onClick handler
Click the button and check browser console to see if it logs
This confirms if the click event is firing

Step 5: Check Component Structure

Verify the dropdown component is placed correctly in the DOM
Check if dropdown has proper z-index to appear above other elements
Ensure dropdown is not hidden by CSS (display: none, opacity: 0, etc.)

Step 6: Verify API Connection

Check if the component is fetching projects list when opened
Look for API errors in browser Network tab
Ensure the projects API endpoint is working

Step 7: Check for Positioning Issues

Verify the dropdown has position: absolute or position: fixed
Check if parent container has proper positioning context
Ensure dropdown is not rendering outside viewport

Step 8: Test with Simple Alert

Temporarily replace the onClick handler with onClick={() => alert('Clicked!')}
If alert shows, the button works - issue is with the dropdown logic
If alert doesn't show, the button click itself is broken

Step 9: Review Component Props

Verify correct props are passed to dropdown component:

itemId (keyword list ID)
itemType (should be 'keyword_list' or similar)
currentProjects (array of assigned projects)
onUpdate callback function



Step 10: Check Browser Console and Network Tab

Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
Check Console tab for errors
Check Network tab for failed API requests
Share any error messages found


Quick Debug Test:
Replace the current button with this temporarily:
<button onClick={() => console.log('Button works!', keywordList.id)}>
  + Add project (TEST)
</button>
If this logs to console, the button itself works and the issue is with the dropdown component logic.
